Markov chains are a fairly common, and relatively simple, way to statistically model random processes.
They have been used in many different domains, ranging from text generation to financial modeling.
Overall, Markov Chains are conceptually quite intuitive, and are very accessible in that they can be implemented without the use of any advanced statistical or mathematical concepts.
They are a great way to start learning about probabilistic modeling and data science techniques.
This example illustrates many of the key concepts of a Markov chain. A Markov chain essentially consists of a set of transitions, which are determined by some probability distribution, that satisfy the Markov property.
